#  Dont-Panic-LUC.github.io

This is Don't Panic's source code for its new and official website. See the link on the sidebar for the live site.

## About the code

We are using [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) for the frontend and [Sapper](https://sapper.svelte.dev/) for the backend/hosting. 

We dynamically render much of the site using Markdown. We recommend you check out the source code if you are new to web development and/or are looking to create a portfolio.

The structure is based off the default [Sapper Template](https://github.com/sveltejs/sapper-template-rollup). See the full details and instruction there. 

## Running Locally

1. `$ npm install`
2. `$ npm dev`
