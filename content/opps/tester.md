The Job, Internship and Service Fair gives Loyola students of all levels and majors an opportunity to explore a variety of opportunities both on and off campus. We anticipate hosting a variety of organizations from the non-profit sector (secular and religious), regional companies and Loyola departments for part time, internship, federal work study, service learning and volunteer opportunities.
