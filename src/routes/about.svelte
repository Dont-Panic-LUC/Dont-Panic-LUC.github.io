<h1>About Us</h1>

<p>
  DON'T PANIC! was started in the Fall of 2018 with the goal of uniting students
  from all the disciplines in the Loyola coding community.
</p>
<p>
  Our aim since the beginning has been to create a community of people who have
  a passion and drive to learn and make friends.
</p>
<p>
  We aim to serve our community in a variety of ways; first being relaxed
  meetings where we get together and discuss important topics in the Computer
  Science field, second being events where we go out and interact with the
  larger Chicago coding community, and finally through our Discord channel,
  where we discuss anything and everything.
